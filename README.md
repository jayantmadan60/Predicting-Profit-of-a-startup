Overview

In this article, we will be predicting the profit from the startup’s dataset with the features available to us. We’re using the 50-startups dataset for this problem statement and we will be using the concept of Multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups companies.

How do startups work?

Well, we can say that startups pipeline operates on the same principles which are similar to other MNCs the major difference between both of them is that on the one hand startups work to make products that are beneficial for the customers on a small scale while other established companies do that work on a large scale by re-doing something which is already being done.

How this model can help here?

This machine learning model will be quite helpful in such a situation where we need to find a profit based on how much we are spending in the market and for the market. In a nutshell, this machine learning model will help to find out the profit based on the amount which we spend from the 50 startups dataset.


About the 50 startups dataset

This particular dataset holds data from 50 startups in New York, California, and Florida. The features in this dataset are R&D spending, Administration Spending, Marketing Spending, and location features, while the target variable is: Profit.

1. R&D spending: The amount which startups are spending on Research and development.
2. Administration spending: The amount which startups are spending on the Admin panel.
3. Marketing spending: The amount which startups are spending on marketing strategies.
4. State: To which state that particular startup belongs.
5. Profit: How much profit that particular startup is making.


Difference between Linear regression and Multiple linear regression

The major difference between linear regression and multiple linear regression is that in linear regression there is only one independent variable while when we check out, Multiple linear regression there is more than one independent variable.

Let’s take an example of both the scenarios

1. Linear regression: When we want to predict the height of one particular person just from the weight of that person.
2. Multiple Linear regression: If we alter the above problem statement just a little bit like, if we have the features like height, age, and gender of the person and we have to predict the weight of the person then we have to use the concept of multiple linear regression.
